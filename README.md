The theme of this project is refactoring.

Since the app on its own is small, I plan to do iterative writing. That is to say, I plan to fly by the seat of my pants and get a minimal viable product working. Then, I will keep on making adjustments and newer versions, refactoring and improving the code as I go.

The plan is to get experience refactoring and iterating code.
