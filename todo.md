Branch out - a real data bank:

- [ ] Add a schema builder. Think a modal that allows you to chose a name and type for each property field and automatically generates all columns

Types of field to add:

- [ ] string
- [ ] number
- [ ] array - each element gets rendered as <li>
- [ ] bool - rendered as checklist
- [ ] date - rendered as date picker
- [ ] dropdown / select - gets a pool of strings to be selected
- [ ] links - gets rendered as link
- [ ] random picker - the user gives a pool of values (values must have same type and be string, number or bool) and a random value is assigned at creation of row
- [ ] Checklist - array made up of preset values

Maybe, maybe, maybe:

- [ ] User-created tiny widgets with inputs. (Think back to resumes and creating formation card like college or course)
- [ ] Combine two columns in one. The cell of the second column gets rendered in a row below the cell of the first
- [ ] Account management (password emails, updates, etc.)
- [ ] Use typescript. The interfaces thing seems pretty good.
- [ ] add Mongoose integration
