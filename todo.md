- [  ] Delete rows and columns
- [  ] Copy, cut and paste roes
- [  ] The instance number
- [  ] The new and close buttons
- [  ] The file and edit buttons
- [  ] A repeat (macro) function
- [  ] Rearrange rows and columns
- [  ] Select value of column \ field type: string, number, array, object
- [  ] Tab and enter movements
- [  ] Transposition
- [  ] Render arrays as html lists
- [  ] Autosave to localstorage
- [  ] Sticky headings bar
- [  ] Add github link for bug\frature request link 

- [ ] Find a better way of dealing with state ???
- [ ] Separate gui from functions ???
- [ ] improve styling (too broad)
- [ ] Do schema file
  - [ ] Do cells in accordance with heading type
- [ ] create wizard for adding rows
- [ ] add Mongoose integration


Branch out - a real data bank:
- [  ] Add a schema builder. Think a modal that allows you to chose a name and type for each property field and automatically generates all columns

Types of field to add:
- [  ] string
- [  ] number
- [  ] array - each element gets rendered as <li>
- [  ] bool - rendered as checklist
- [  ] date - rendered as date picker
- [  ] dropdown / select - gets a pool of strings to be selected
- [  ] links - gets rendered as link
- [  ] random picker - the user gives a pool of values (values must have same type and be string, number or bool) and a random value is assigned at creation of row
- [  ] Checklist - array made up of preset values 

Maybe, maybe, maybe:
- [  ] User-created tiny widgets with inputs. (Think back to resumes and creating formation card like college or course)
- [  ] Combine two columns in one. The cell of the second column gets rendered in a row below the cell of the first
- [  ] Account management (password emails, updates, etc.)
- [  ] Use typescript. The interfaces thing seems pretty good.
