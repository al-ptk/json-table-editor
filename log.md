## Day 1

I decided to take a more free flow style to coding because I had problems with my last project and I wanted to explore what refactoring is like. It's quite the change!  
I forgot about atomic commits, so I shall bring them back tomorrow.  
I also realized that the pre-planning I did before was very useful as a tasks-to-do record. Maybe I can combine both free-flow and pre-planned approached, where I set the basic idea on the planning tool, start coding and, instead of writing everything before-hand, I use the planning as a record-and-tracking tool. Something to experiment and see!  
Lastly, I'm glad to be back coding. Life has been a bit crazy lately.

## Day 2

As I feared, it all goes back to a dauting spaghetti web. It is very easy to lose track of what to do and how to proceed. Plus, there is the constant concern of "not doing things right."  
I feel like this project must be an experiment: Allow myself to just be bad and see how it goes. Not doing so blocks me up and I become unproductive.  
I should not be afraid of the dumb solution. If I must rewrite, I shall rewrite. If I must change the structure later, I shall do so. I must stupidly and bravely move foward so I do not get bog down by analysis paralysis.  
There will be tons of books later teaching me to become better, but I need some experience being a bad coder and just moving on.

## Day 3

I thought of a new way of solving the issue. This wouldn't have happened if I didn't have the experience of just improvising as I go. Now I wonder if there is a cheaper and quicker way of trying solutions before implementing them. Maybe a javscript pseudocode?  
Regardless, this experience proves a point: I need more experience in general, and need to change my mind around certain ideas I have about coding. Perhaps it is perfectly fine to just do stuff until you have a better way of solving the issue, then spending more time to rewrite code. Modular code seems like a pretty good approach â€” in webdesign terms, decoupling the style from the functionality is automatically done because of the separate languages, CSS and JS.
