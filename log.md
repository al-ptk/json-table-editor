# Day 1

I decided to take a more free flow style to coding because I had problems with my last project and I wanted to explore what refactoring is like. It's quite the change!  
I forgot about atomic commits, so I shall bring them back tomorrow.  
I also realized that the pre-planning I did before was very useful as a tasks-to-do record. Maybe I can combine both free-flow and pre-planned approached, where I set the basic idea on the planning tool, start coding and, instead of writing everything before-hand, I use the planning as a record-and-tracking tool. Something to experiment and see!  
Lastly, I'm glad to be back coding. Life has been a bit crazy lately.

# Day 2

As I feared, it all goes back to a dauting spaghetti web. It is very easy to lose track of what to do and how to proceed. Plus, there is the constant concern of "not doing things right."  
I feel like this project must be an experiment: Allow myself to just be bad and see how it goes. Not doing so blocks me up and I become unproductive.  
I should not be afraid of the dumb solution. If I must rewrite, I shall rewrite. If I must change the structure later, I shall do so. I must stupidly and bravely move foward so I do not get bog down by analysis paralysis.  
There will be tons of books later teaching me to become better, but I need some experience being a bad coder and just moving on.
