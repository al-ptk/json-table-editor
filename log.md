# Day 1

I decided to take a more free flow style to coding because I had problems with my last project and I wanted to explore what refactoring is like. It's quite the change!  
I forgot about atomic commits, so I shall bring them back tomorrow.  
I also realized that the pre-planning I did before was very useful as a tasks-to-do record. Maybe I can combine both free-flow and pre-planned approached, where I set the basic idea on the planning tool, start coding and, instead of writing everything before-hand, I use the planning as a record-and-tracking tool. Something to experiment and see!  
Lastly, I'm glad to be back coding. Life has been a bit crazy lately.
